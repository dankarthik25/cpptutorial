/*
        Polymorphism
    1. Compile-time / early binding/ static binding
    2. Run-time/ late binding / dynamic binding

        Compile-time :
            1. Functions overloaded, 
            2.  Operator overloaded
        Run time :
            1. Function Overriding
            assign different meaning to samefunction at run time.

    Allows us to program more abstractly 
        Think general Vs Specific
        Let C++ figure out  which function to call at run-time.

In c++ assignment is static (at compile time) : faster

Not default in C++ , run-time polymorphism is via 
    Inheritance
    Base class pointers or reference
    Virtual Functions.

run-time is done by using base class as pointer or references or virtual functions.
