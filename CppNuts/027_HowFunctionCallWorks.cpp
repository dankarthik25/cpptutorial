/*
    FUNCTION 
    FUNCTION uses "funciton call stack(LIFO) " 
        { create  stack to pass the return and parameter  }
        push and pop based on operation need to perform and 
        Stack terminate after returning the "return value" to main 

    
    Stack Fram or Activation Record
        Each time function is called we create a new actiation record or stack
        When function is terminated we pop  stack
        
    Stack Overflow 
        stack size is finite, if the functions call stack is more then it is called stack overflow
