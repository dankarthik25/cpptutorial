    Need to know  Lvalue(having addressable) and Rvalue(tempory value create by complier)

    total = 100+ 200;
    Simillar thing happes for copy,deep copy constructors
    For obj we have greate overhead  and called over and over again.
        If there are raw pointer then we need ot use deep copy construtors. 
    This is computationally implemented(create stack, push and pop).

    For this move constructor is used
